Mrs. Cortlandt Van Rensselaer Hodge
is the only Philadelphia woman in China
living in the very heart of the district in
which the Boxers are committing their
outrages. She and her husband, who is a
physician, were at the Presbyterian mis-
sion at Paotingfu, near Peking. Mrs. Hodge
was formerly Miss Sinclair.
