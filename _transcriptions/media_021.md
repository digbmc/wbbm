**Minister Conger Cable that Missionaries at Pao Ting Fug Have Been Massacred**
Washington, Sept. 13--Minister Conger cables the state department to-
day:
"The Simcoxes, Powells and Hodges, Presbyterian mossionaries\[sic\], were killed
at Pao-Ting-Fu." 
Such is the brief but official mes-
sage which will change half-hopeful,
anxious hearts in Ceder Rapids to
sorrowing ones. The simple announce-
ment from Minister Conger confirms
the fears for the safety of one of 
Ceder Rapids' most beloved daugh-
ters, Mrs. Cortlandt Van Renssalaer 
Hodge, formerly Miss Elsie Sinclair,
who with her husband and their
companions in Pao-Ting-Fu perished
at the hands of the Boxers. Ever
since the trouble in China com--
menced the hopes of relatives and 
friends here have been alternately
encouraged an depressed by the
messages which related to the safety
or danger of the missionaries at Pao-
Ting-Fu. There came the report that
all foreigners in the place had per-
ished. 



[exceprt from **"Thrilled With Horror. Foreigners at Pekin\[sic\] Now Realize True Conditions"**]
Today the foreign commun--
ity was thrilled with horror at the 
news of the massacre of the mission-
aries at Paoting-Fu, who were under
the protection of the imeperial troops.
Children were butchered before the
eyes of their parents. White women
were ravished and carried into cap-
tivity. Parents were tortured and 
murdered. Massacres by red Indians
never call in vain for vengeance. Yet
the troops remain here inactive. Their
one thought and wish are to be given
work or to be recalled from Pekin.
Surely the civilized world will not suf-
fer this cruel massacre to remain
unavenged and make no effort to as-
certain the fate of the poor martyred
Christians and white women.
"Since the relief of the legations
one feature stands conspicuous--the
predominance of Russia and the over-
mastering position she is now assert-
ing here. The pageant in the forbid-
den city on Aug. 28 was a triumph-
ant entry by Russia, followed by the
other powers. Russia did the hon-
ors, greatly to the chagrin of the
other ministers."
