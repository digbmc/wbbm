**Two Views of Japan**
**Oh, Fair Japan**
"oh, fair Japan; Oh, rare Japan
Though land of ancient trees,
Where lotus blossoms fringe thy paths
And perfume every breeze.

"Where lilies bend their fragrant heads
To kiss thy plashing streams,
and dark-skinned musme, almond-eyed,
Wake long forgotten dreams.

"Thy hills, crown-capp'd with sacred groves
Inclose thy gilded shrines;
In grottos where the iris blooms
Droop sweet wistaria vines.

"Mysterious languor seems to hang
O'er mountain, plain and rill;
An unreality of life,
Does all the sense fill.

"Thine ancient shrines to Buddha blest,
With Shinto's gilded spires,
Proclaim a soul-sustaining rest,
And wake poetic fires.

"Oh, sweet it is to dwell with thee!
'Land of the Rising Sun,"--
Where beauty, art and myster
Combine themselves in one."
