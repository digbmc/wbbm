**Oh! Fair (?) Japan**
"Oh hang Japan; oh dang Japan,
A land of gnats and fleas,
Where noisom odors fill the air
And float on every breeze.
Where men run naked on the streets,
Wear spectacles for clothes,
And old and young, and rich and poor
Eschew the use of hose.

"A land devoid of knives and forks,
Of tables, chairs, and beds;
Where women black their teeth and shave
Their little babies' heads--
I've had enough, (I have no use
A quiet New York man)
For all this nude simplicity
Careering 'round Japan.

"Boy, bring my clothes up from the wash
As quickly as you can,
Sir Edwin Arnold writes a lot
Of bosh about Japan.
I'm shivering cold, I'm wringing wet,
I've been an idle dreamer;
To Yokohama let me get,
And there, thank God, a steamer."

Dr. William Dodd Helmuth
