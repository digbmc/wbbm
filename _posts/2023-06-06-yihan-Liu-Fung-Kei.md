Bryn Mawr alumnae in China and Japan wrote to each other to tell their accomplishments, prospects, and difficulties every year. Among the letters from Japan, Japanese alumnae seemed to provide material for evaluating the practical outcome of American training. But as one turned to the letters from China for possible comparisons, no letters were from Chinese alumnae. Spearheaded by Professor Lucy Donnelly, who was also a Bryn Mawr alumna, the Chinese scholarship was founded as “The study of Chinese art and literature is becoming more and more a part of our education. Acquaintance and friendship with modern Chinese girls should give more reality to the study of their ancient arts and should add greatly to the variety and interest of campus life. The enterprise of securing a Chinese scholarship is not merely a doing of duty. It should have something of the color of adventure, of reaching out into new regions of interest.”

The members of the Chinese scholarship committee considered students from Canton Christian College, the North China Union College for Women, and St. Hilda’s. Candidates included the daughter of a wealthy merchant, the sister of a Chinese poet, and so on. The committee finally chose Liu Fung Kei from Canton Christian College as the first Bryn Mawr Chinese scholar. [^1]

Liu Fung Kei was born in Canton, China. Her father, Liu Tak Shan, was a Baptist minister and a medical doctor.  He graduated from the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, where he met and became friends with Sun Yat Sen, the first provisional president of the Republic of China and the founder of the Nationalist Party of China. Liu Fung Kei was the third of ten children. Of the seven daughters, four had become principals of schools. Liu Fung Kei's two older sisters both received education master’s degrees from Columbia University. After being chosen as the first Chinese scholar of Bryn Mawr College, Liu Fung Kei studied first at Shipley School and then graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1922. She returned to China upon graduation and founded Yuet Wah School in Macau, because she aspired to see a school “which is not for propaganda, for business, nor positions, but for giving the children true education”.
