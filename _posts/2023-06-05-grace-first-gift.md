Have you ever stopped to think about the bell in Taylor Hall? No, not the big one that everyone rings at the end of semester. I’m talking about the bell on the first floor when you walk down the hall towards admin offices. If you’ve never noticed it before, don’t worry: I didn’t even realize it existed until this summer.

This bell is important because it reportedly was the first major gift to the college. The temple bell was given by Mary Morris in 1894, who is credited as a friend of Bryn Mawr College. She served as a chairman on the Japanese scholarship program for Bryn Mawr. In addition, she was also a founder of the Foreign Missionary Association, which was a group dedicated to introducing Quakerism to Japan. As part of her work, she visited Japan twice on missionary trips. Her missionary work meant that she likely would have come to learn about Japanese culture and customs. However, though missionary work was considered “normal” back then, that does not minimize the damage or inherent imperialistic beliefs that fuel this type of work. The ethics of her missionary life could be its own blog post, so for the sake of keeping things short, I bring up her missionary work as a way to simply contextualize her gift to Bryn Mawr and why she specifically chose to gift a Japanese bell.

The bell is a reproduction of a 19th century Japanese temple bell. Yihan translated the text on the bell and told me that it was finished in 1846 by Gombei Tanaka. This type of bell is referred to as a bonsho (sacred bell). Bonsho bells are located in Japanese Buddhist temples, many of which are still used to this day. These bells come in a variety of sizes, with some being incredibly large, while others range to the size similar to the one at Bryn Mawr.
<!-- contextualize the size? -->

The bells can have multiple meanings depending on the person such as evoking a sense of nostalgia and cultural pride, commitments to spirituality, and to call monks to worship. Because of its unique shape and design, the bell has a deep, rich long resonating sound very different from the church bells many Americans may be used to. The bell produces a somber yet calming ring that allows its listeners to reflect their own spirituality. Some also believe that the bell is the buddha’s voice calling for those to reflect upon their commitment to Buddhism.

The bell’s inscription on the side reads “Dedicated to the Tama Shrine of Kitano.” Some searching found that there is a temple called Kitano Tenmangu Shrine in Kyoto, Japan built in 947. This shrine is dedicated to the Japanese statesman Sugawara no Michizane. There are scrolls called Kitano Tenjin Engi Emaki, which detail his rise to political prominence and eventual exile.  After his death in exile, a series of natural disasters and disease struck the capital, many believing he was seeking revenge on those who exiled him. To appease his vengeful spirit, a shrine built to deify him as Tenjin and venerated as a Shinto god. His story is even more significant given that he was the first person in Japan to be deified as a god after death.

I would also like to address how the bell currently hangs in Taylor Hall. A previous plaque read that traditionally the bell may rest on a pillow; however this is incorrect. *Bonsho* bells would have been hung so that when struck, their sound would be able to resonate fully. Perhaps this was confused with an *orin* bell, which is a much smaller, bowl-shaped bell that does rest on a pillow. Typically, *bonsho* bells would have a long, wooden mallet to strike the bell. Though I have done a lot of research about *bonsho* bells themselves, I still know relatively little about how this bell came to Bryn Mawr, but I hope that this research can highlights the bell’s interesting history and its importance to Japanese culture.
