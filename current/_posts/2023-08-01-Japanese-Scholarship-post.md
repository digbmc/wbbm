After Ume Tsuda graduated from Bryn Mawr College, she decided to help more Japanese women to receive higher education in the United States and uplift the position of Japanese women. To raise $8,000 to fund a permanent scholarship, Tsuda gave several speeches and successfully engaged with the evangelical audience by stating that with the dissemination of Christian values, the existing gender discrimination in Confucianism and Buddhism can be palliated. 

Tsuda selected four members in Japan who were approved by two Christian ministers they were eager to spread Christianity and pursue the development of Japanese women’s education. They then had a meeting with a committee that consisted of members of the Quaker, Episcopal, and Presbyterian faiths who aimed to raise funds and administer the scholarship for the Japanese students to study in the Philadelphia area. Mary Harris Morris, the chairman of the committee, went on missions to Japan twice despite the Quakers around her did not believe missionary work in Japan would succeed, and devoted herself to forming the Philadelphia Japanese Scholarship Committee. An official notice was sent to several schools for girls in Japan after the meeting, specifying a four-year scholarship would be offered. The candidates should be unmarried and between the ages of seventeen and thirty. 

The first recipient of the Japanese Scholarship of Bryn Mawr College was Michi Matsuda. She was taking classes at Doshisha girls’ school in Kyoto, a Christian college when applying for the Japanese Scholarship.[^1]Matsuda was twenty-four years old then, and she was considered well past the suitable age for marriage in Japan at that time. Although she passed the examinations designed to have high-level difficulty and was highly recommended by her teachers, Ume Tsuda expressed worries for her in a letter to the Japanese Scholarship Committee because Tsuda thought she lacked vivacity and “attractiveness which personal beauty carries within it”.[^2]

Michi Matsuda began to study at Bryn Mawr College in 1895 after a year of preparation in the United States and earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in history and political science in 1899. The committee led by Mary Harris Morris hoped the scholarship could be open to all Japanese women, but the notice published in Japan referred to teacher training since it was Tsuda’s main goal of founding the scholarship. The applicants must pass an exam in Mathematics, Japanese history, Chinese, and English. Few women other than those who studied in missionary schools were able to pass the exams in English. Therefore, the early recipients were all Christians and chose to be educators after they returned to Japan. The second recipient Michi Kawai taught at Tsuda College after she graduated, and founded YWCA in Japan and Keisen School for Girls. She also worked with the members of the American Education Mission as one of the two female Japanese educators. The other one was Ai Hoshino, the fourth recipient of the Japanese Scholarship, who had also taught at Tsuda College and became the president of the College in 1929. The Tsuda College had four presidents, and three of them were Bryn Mawr alumnae, including Tsuda herself, Ai Hoshino, and Taki Fujita, who was the seventh recipient of the Japanese scholarship. Many of them taught English after returning to Japan, including the third recipient Ata Suzuki, the sixth recipient Fumi Uchida, the eighth recipient Hannah Ban Matsumiya, and the ninth recipient Shizu Nakamura.

M. Carey Thomas also facilitated the founding of the Japanese Scholarship. She had a meeting with Ume Tsuda in 1891, resulting in the establishment of the Japanese Scholarship Committee.[^3]She not only participated in formulating the policies and finances of the Japanese Scholarship but also helped Tsuda complete the scripts of the speeches to raise funds.[^4]What’s more, after Tsuda returned to Japan, she wrote to Tsuda from time to time to tell her about the Japanese students’ academic performance.[^5]

However, it is also vital to mention M. Carey Thomas’s disdain for the Japanese. According to one of her letters to her family members in 1917, she mentioned “Japanese seem to be indefinite and unserviceable for modern requirements and quite impossible to write with Chinese characters. We have made up our minds that they are Orientals and savages and that in spite of their wonderfully intelligent government, they can never compete with us. They are radically unintelligent-I feel sure. The Mongolian type is very marked as soon as one goes through the country. They look like so many Esquimaury telling rice fields instead of spearing seal.” [^6]
