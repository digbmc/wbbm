description: It is well known that Thomas held many prejudice beliefs against non-Western people and cultures; however, I aim to directly discuss her strong support of Eugenics and great disdain for Asian people despite working with Tsuda Umeko to create the Japanese Scholarship program at Bryn Mawr.

It’s well known within the Bryn Mawr community that M. Carey Thomas lived a lavish lifestyle. She spared no expense when it came to designing and subsequently re-designing the Deanery, her on campus house, which she donated to the Alumnae Association upon her retirement. However, she also travelled luxuriously as well. Throughout her career as president and beyond, Thomas travelled extensively, especially given her time period. This past week, I read through some of her letters to family and friends regarding her travels within Asia and North Africa. I include North Africa, as historically Westerners often included countries like Egypt as part of the “Orient,” indicating that they viewed the country as part of Asia. For the rest of this article, I will use “Asia” in this frame to highlight the historical misconception.

In 1911, Thomas spent several months in Cairo, Egypt. Her views on Egypt highlight her (and many white people’s) complicated beliefs about non-Western nations, specifically “Asian” ones. Within the first few paragraphs of a letter to family and friends, Thomas reveals that she revels in Egypt’s seemingly historic lifestyle, stating “it is wonderful to be in the Orient with millions of people dressed as they were in the time of Abraham” (Reel 33, p. 0126). Later  in the same letter she describes how agriculture is still “plowed by camels and buffaloes and donkeys yoked together all their implements used are same as those shown on the walls of the tombs 3000 years ago” (Reel 33, p. 0135). She delights in how archaic places like Egypt appear to her.  

Similarly, in her travels to India she comments that the country appears to be stuck in time: “India is a world in itself, an ancient, not a modern world, in spite of English comfort and safety. It is a vast, prehistoric continent, the great majority of whose 319 millions of peoples are still as they were centuries ago” (Reel 33, p. 0514). Like with Egypt, she views India as this vast land that has never truly developed; however, in her next line she also reveals a distaste for a non-Western lifestyle: “…it throws a flood of light on what we all came from. We were all there once. It is a terrifying example of what we may revert to, if our present civilization perishes, as it easily may unless we pull ourselves together” (ibid). This line indicates that though she may revel how “backward” these countries appear to her, she would not not wish to live there, highlighting her complicated view on the world. 

Though Thomas admired the rich history of places like Egypt and East Asia (not so much India from what I have read), she held a deep prejudice against the people living in said countries. When talking about Japanese people, Thomas wrote about her and her friend’s perspective: “we have also made up our minds that they are Orientals and savages and that in spite of their wonderfully intelligent government they can never compete with us. They are radically unintelligent - I feel sure” (Reel 33, p. 0176). A common way of portraying her prejudice was by describing non-white people as lacking “intellect.” This notion of “intellect” comes straight the eugenicist belief that traits such as “intellect” were passed down and that only certain races possessed them. Whenever Thomas refers to a non-White person as lacking “intellect,” she’s speaking from a point of view rooted in eugenics . She made this critique about almost every group of people she meets on her travels. However  this was not the only way she showed her distaste in the actual people from the places she visited.

Her comment stating how she believes Japan can never compete with “us” has a few layers. First, she holds a white supremist view that only white, Western people could have a civilized society. Though she may think Japan has a few good things, her racist views mean that she always viewed non-white people as naturally inferior. Secondly, she could also be referring to Japan attempting to emulate European countries during the Meiji period. In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Japan went through the Meiji restoration period where Japan made major political, social, and economic changes. In some ways, Japan modeled Europe, especially after taking control of Korea, Taiwan, and Sakhalin Island by the time Thomas visited in 1915. Perhaps Thomas did not know any of this history. But it was clear that regardless of what Japan or Japanese people did, she was also going to be prejudice against them simply because they were not white.

Almost every “Asian” country Thomas visited was greatly affected by European colonization in some form (Egypt, China, India, Sri Lanka), something she whole heartedly supported. As exemplified in the first quote, she approved of the English approach to setting up tourism in Egypt. This is not a distinct event, as she goes on to support colonization in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, remarking how great the tourism is. Of course she neglects to acknowledge any of the actual economic, social, and political damage done by colonization. In countries such as China and Japan (never colonized by Europe), she expresses a belief that more Western influence would improve the countries, “the method of writing both Chinese and Japanese is quite impossible. They will have to adapt our Latin letters. Also their languages are not adapted to the accuracy of modern thought. It looks as if English would really be at least their second language” (Reel 33, p. 0233). Clearly she views Western influence as the only way forward. Her easy dismissal of the Chinese and Japanese languages also highlights how even if she admires the aesthetic of Asia, she lacks a true cultural understanding or appreciation in any form.

Thomas travelled far and wide around the world. Yet her perspectives never changed. In fact, in a letter to her family while abroad , she recommends they read two books by Lothrop Stoddard, a prominent American eugenicist who was strongly for race-based immigration restrictions. It is evident from Thomas’ writing that she greatly admired him and agreed with him on many issues. Her contradictory view of these “Asian” countries could not be more stark. She loved their historical and material culture, yet is deeply prejudice against the people who produced those items. She was an avid supporter of a prominent eugenicist while still using the aesthetics of Asian countries to show off her own wealth. 

I bring all this up as a way to contextualize the rest of our summer research. Even as Thomas is filling her Deanery with furniture and art from across the world,  she actively despised the people who are creating these objects. To reconcile Thomas’ difficult views with the fact we still prominently display some of the Deanery objects (much of which is Asian) is important in understanding Orientalism both historically and in its modern-day form. As the summer continues, I hope to investigate Thomas’s relationship further with Asia and dig into her collecting habits.
