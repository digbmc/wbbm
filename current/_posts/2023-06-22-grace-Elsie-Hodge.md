Content waring: brief discussion of sexual assault, racist caricatures shown

For this week, I’m talking about the Elsie Sinclair Hodge bench that sits between Guild and Dalton. It’s a giant, white stone bench; however, despite its size the bench is often overlooked on our campus. If anyone ever took a closer look at it, they would see that the inscription on the bench reads “alum Elsie Sinclair Hodge died in the Massacre of Christians at Paotingfu China June 1900.” Quite the inscription. This certainly piqued my interest and I couldn’t help but wonder who this woman was and how she ended up in China during the Boxer Rebellion.

Elsie Sinclair Hodge was a Bryn Mawr alum and a member of the class of 1897. As a student, she was captain of the basketball team and was even got a mention in the Philadelphia Inquirer for winning championships. A year after leaving Bryn Mawr, Elsie got engaged to Dr. Cortlandt Hodge, a recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania where he received his medical degree. However, Cortlandt Hodge did not intend to work in the states. Instead, he wanted to become a medical missionary. Sometime  during their engagement Cortlandt was assigned to Paotingfu 保定市，河北省 (modern day Baoding, Hebei).

Dr. Cortlandt Hodge’s interest in missionary work is not surprising, given that his father, Reverend Edward Blanchard Hodge, was a Presbyterian minister and a strong proponent of missionary work. Elsie also had a connection to missionary work, as her father, Thomas M. Sinclair, had gone on a few Presbyterian missionary trips within the US. However, within his hometown he was most known for being a successful merchant. Elsie and Cortlandt got married in a Presbyterian church on February 14, 1899 and a few weeks later the two sailed for China with the well-wishes of family and friends. 

Though their permanent station was Baoding, the two spent time in Peitaiho 北戴河，河北省 (now known as Beidaihe in Hebei province, a coastal resort town in Northern China). I was able to gain more insight into Elsie’s personal feelings and accounts of her life because her letters to family were donated to Bryn M as part of  Andrew H. Wood’s (her brother-in-law). According to Elsie’s letters, she and Cortlandt stayed in a house with fellow missionaries from across the world.  

From my knowledge of missionary work, they were likely there to to initially learn how to be a missionary. I actually have an odd family connection to missionary work, because on my mother’s side of my adoptive family, her great aunt, affectionately referred to as Aunt Hun by friends and family, was a missionary in China during the early to mid twentieth century. Aunt Hun’s letters and personal memoir have helped me learn a lot about how missionary missions worked historically and on her own passion for missionary work. She was a good example of someone who had a deep passion for missionary work, but also a deep respect for Chinese culture and language. Throughout reading Elsie’s letters, I used my knowledge of my great great aunt to help inform my understanding of missionary work in China. 

While in Beidaihe, she and Cortlandt studied Chinese to prepare them for missionary work, which Elsie indicated  she enjoyed in her letters. However, they would eventually go back to Baoding at the end of the summer, and Elsie was less enthusiastic about this. She was worried about keeping house in a foreign country, which she hadn’t had to worry about back home in the US, and to further her dissatisfaction, she hated the house they were staying in. 

While reading her letters, I noticed she appears less enthusiastic about missionary work than what had been previously reported in newspapers and stories of her. It wasn’t that she explicitly stated her dislike of missionary work, in fact it was the lack of discussion that surprised me. Despite living in another country, she never mentions meeting or interacting with any Chinese people in a missionary setting. The only mention I found was in a letter to her younger sister Agnes (also a Bryn Mawr alum), where she describes teaching some Chinese school girls how to sew. However she finds this to be challenging given that her “Chinese was of a limited character.” She later admits that teaching the girls to sew was “nil because some of them sew far better than I can pretend to.” This surprised me as I had sort of expected her to teach or have more interactions with the children at the school, because most women who became missionaries during that time worked with children or in schools. That was also the case of my great great aunt who worked in several different missionary schools and found a great deal of pride and love for her students. 

It seemed that Elsie was homesick and always looking to the past to cheer herself up. In a letter, Elsie reveals how much she enjoys receiving their letters, writing “I was glad to hear from you especially as very few of the girls have written to me since I arrived in China and it is the vest kind of good work to write… as far from home as I am, — letters are especially precious treasure out here.” In another letter, she tells her sister Agnes “I know what a real joy it is to look back over the good times,” which I interpreted as her childhood and college years given that she had just addressed Agnes struggling at Bryn Mawr. It seemed from the letters I read, Elsie was homesick and looking to her past to cheer herself up. Though she was not always lonely, having made a few missionary friends as well. The more I read, the more it became clear that Elsie was just a young woman who got swept up in her husband’s plans.

About a year into their missionary work, the Hodges began  hearing rumors about Chinese locals attacking Catholic missionaries. In a letter dated April 24, 1900, Elsie recounted hearing news about the Boxers going after Catholic missionaries; however, she wrote off the encounter  as “anti-Catholic rather than anti-foreign.” She went on to elaborate that Catholics had interfered too much in local politics, while Protestants stayed away. In Elsie’s mind, this meant that Protestants would be spared from any violence. In retrospect, this letter is rather ominous, given that less than two months later Elsie Hodge and her husband were both be killed in the Boxer Rebellion. 

From Western perspectives, the Boxer Rebellion was  characterized as Chinese people mindlessly killing Christians. Newspapers took the opportunity to describe China as uncivilized and unruly, further pushing the narrative that Asia at large, and China in particular, couldn’t ever be considered equal to the Western world. However reality is not so black and white.

At the turn of the century, China was in the midst of the “One hundred Years of Humiliation.” This term describes a period in Chinese history from the mid nineteenth century to the end of WWII where foreign invasions from Japan and the West significantly weakened China’s government and forced unfair trade. This time period had begun with Britain winning the Opium Wars and flooding China with opium, leaving local communities devasted by the drug. This also caused heavy economic disparities in China’s poorer provinces. Understandably people were not happy with what they perceived as foreign encroachment on their homes and culture. Thus came the rise of the 义和拳 (”The Harmonious and Righteous fists” or yihequan), or the “Boxers” to Westerners. 

The group blamed foreign influence in China for the recent natural disasters, economic poverty, and increased Western involvement in political decision making. Missionaries and Chinese Christian Converts further provoked the group as they disregarded or disrespected Chinese traditions. The Boxers attacked Chinese Christians and missionaries, hoping to eradicate all foreign influence in China. In June of 1900, the Boxers began to seize Beijing’s Legation district (where most foreign diplomats lived) and the Dowager Empress Cixi declared war on all foreign nationals in the country. Soon, Western nations and Japan flooded China to defeat the Boxers. In total, it is estimated that several thousand Chinese Christians and 200-300 mainly Christian foreign missionaries were killed during the rebellion.

It was believed that Elsie and her husband were killed soon after they returned from a trip in Peking. Back in the states, their deaths were highly sensationalized. The tragedy of their deaths fueled the growing outcry against China, and drew more sympathy for missionaries overseas. Across the country, newspapers printed the names of Elsie Sinclair Hodge and her husband Cortlandt Hodge, calling them Christian martyrs, people who were so dedicated to their religion that they would die for it. Newspaper after newspaper printed stories about the tragic couple, regardless of whether the details were correct or not. At least half of the newspapers confused Cortland Hodge for his father, reporting that he was a minister and graduate of Princeton. This further shows how newspapers were simply using the Hodge’s death for clout instead of reporting the correct facts. One newspaper noted that Elsie Hodge was the “only Philadelphia woman in China,” further sensationalizing the idea of how vulnerable she was. Another newspaper made a point of talking about how white women were being assaulted and taken away in Beijing (Pekin).

While I am certainly not dismissing the very real tragedies that happened because of the Boxer Rebellion, I also want to highlight that emphasizing what happened to specifically white women, while disregarding the many Chinese Christian men and women who were also hurt or killed during the rebellion sends a certain message about whose lives do and do not deserve value. In fact, during the Boxer Rebellion, thousands more Chinese Christians were killed or hurt than foreign missionaries. This choice of framing was incredibly intentional. Several newspapers used white women as props to perpetuate the narrative that the Boxer Rebellion was nothing but senseless violence against the most vulnerable. This sentiment echoes World War II propaganda that would emerge later and claim that white womanhood was at stake. Elsie Sinclair Hodge, simply because she was a white woman in China, became memorialized gaining more fame in death than I am sure she would have ever imagined. The press turned her into a martyr, an example of the cruelty of China. She became a message more than a real person in the end. 

The Elsie Hodge whose letters I read was a young woman that deeply cared for her family and friends. She delighted in keeping contact with them even when she was half way across the world. Perhaps, as she lived in China, she personally became more fond of it, but in her letters, she showed little enthusiasm for missionary work or for the country itself. Simply put, it appears Elsie Hodge was a young woman who got swept up in a family and a mission much larger than herself.  It became abundantly clear, reading her letters, that Elsie would not have desired the level of fame that she received after her death. In fact, the only thing she truly seemed to want was to be with her family again. In writing this post, I hope to honor her life in a more realistic sense. Perhaps not a martyr, but a Mawrter nonetheless.
