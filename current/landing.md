                <em>Who Built Bryn Mawr? 2023-2026</em> is an iteration of the Who Built Bryn Mawr? project that focuses on researching Asian histories at the college, from its founding to the present day. Each year, student interns will research and curate a small exhibit, intervention on campus, reparative object labels, or other projects within a smaller area of interest and keep a blog to document their research.

                ‘Asian histories’ is a broad topic, and there are so many stories that have not been told in Bryn Mawr’s official histories. This four year project allows the time and space for deeper research into unresearched and lesser known stories that deeply affect the college today. At the end of the four-year timeline, a large exhibit encompassing all of the research that has been done will be created.
